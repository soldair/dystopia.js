maybe? another camping conference but about extreme skills that shouldnt be so extreme


### me being silly

mass infrastructure has failed. we have no power. we have no food, but we have rasberry pis and a few node/iojs source tars kicking around.

what do we do? cheese, forts, plants, batteries, p2p networking, sensors, fire lets not take anyting for granted.

what if we could build tools we need to create meaningful real permanent value in our lives. tools we dont need to manually opperate. We could build the basic living income dream without being beholden to anything but the framework of atoms and electrons etc.
