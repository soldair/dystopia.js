============

another camping conference but about extreme skills that shouldnt be so extreme

## ABOUT

This conf should be about teaching / and collecting the skills required to live a comfortable life even if infrastructure fails. I'm not talking about doomsday prepper style, but we should know how to alloy metals, preserve foods, build structures, control servos and read sensors. All of these crafts have changed dramatically since the pre industrial days mostly because advancements in science, industrial process, and the fine work of people like you connecting the dots. Those that havn't have become specializations rather than the common practice they once were.

## when

2016 ish?


### thoughts.

the conference could be structured as a story/experience. or more structured classes.

mass infrastructure has failed. we have no power. we have no food, but we have rasberry pis and a few node/iojs source tars kicking around.

what do we do? cheese, forts, plants, batteries, p2p networking, sensors, fire ... lets not take anyting for granted.

what if we could build tools we need to create meaningful real permanent value in our lives. tools we dont need to manually opperate. We could build the basic living income dream without being beholden to anything but the framework of atoms and electrons etc.
